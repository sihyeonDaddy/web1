    <strong>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/)</strong> </a>, often abbreviated as JS,
    is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
    [10] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled,
    and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
    prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of
    the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for
    web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
    Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code
    on the user's device.
  </p><p>
    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
    functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
    programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
    expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM)
