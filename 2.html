    the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting
by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity
and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be
 cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file an
 d its formatting.
